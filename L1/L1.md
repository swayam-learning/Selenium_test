What is WebDriver?
WebDriver is one of the component in Selenium,WebDriver is a module ,
WebDriver supports Firefox browser ----> Firefox(),Chrome Browser ----> Chrome()

Web Driver is an API(Application Programming Interface) 
API? --- A it basically is an interface between presentation layer and backend(database) layer

WebDriver basically acts as an API between the automation code and the Browser
it basically tries to understand the automation script and following that tests the same thing on the application under test


We need browser specific drivers to run a selenium auotmation code so it can invoke the driver
through json wire protocol(uptill selenium 3.x) , but now everything uses W3C protocol(from selenium 4.x)

Broswer Specific Driver communicate with W3C protocol(collection of multiple Standards)

There is a major architectural change in slenium 4.x from 3.x (basically in the protocols used)

Selenium 4.x
Selenium Language Bindings ---W3C--->Brower Drivers --->W3C--->Broswers

Selenium 3.x
Selenium Language Bindings ---JSON Wire Protocols--->Brower Drivers --->W3C--->Broswers
